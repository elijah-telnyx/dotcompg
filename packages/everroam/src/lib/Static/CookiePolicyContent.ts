How does EverRoam use cookies?
----------------------------

At EverRoam, we want to be transparent about the user information we collect and how we use it. We use cookies across the EverRoam.com domain, to support the functionality of our portal, to understand how our customers use our service and to track how the public is engaging with our public content.

We collect anonymized tracking information to understand in general how users interact with our domain, and when users opt in to our service or our marketing programs, the personal data they provide may be associated with that previously anonymized tracking data. This information helps us understand our performance, streamline workflows and place the most relevant information in front of site visitors.

All personal information is maintained internally, and no information is shared with outside parties for commercial purposes unrelated to EverRoam's business without your express permission. For more information, visit our [Privacy Policy](https://EverRoam.com/privacy-policy).
